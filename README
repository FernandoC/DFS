Files Submitted: List.c, List.h, ListTest.c, Graph.c, Graph.h, GraphTest.c, FindComponents.c, Makefile, and README

List.c:             Contains the doubly linked List ADT and all its functions.

List.h:             Contains all the functions names in List.c to be used in FindComponent.c

ListTest.c:         Contains a program that uses the List ADT to make sure everything
                    is in order by calling all of its functions. 

Graph.c:            Contains the Graph ADT along with the DFS functions

Graph.h:            Contains all the function names in Graph.c to be used in FindComponent.c

GraphTest.c:        Contains a program that uses the Graph ADT to make sure everything 
                    is in order by calling all of its functions. 

FindComponents.c:   Contains the top level program that reads in a formated file and turns it into
                    a graph. It then proceeds to run DFS on the graph and finds its SCCs. 

Makefile:           Compiles everything and makes the Shuffle program into a jar file.

README:              The title serves its purpose.

Description: A simple Depth First Search program written in C. FindComponent used an Adjacency List to calculate
strongly connected components in a formated file representing a digraph. 

To Compile simply download all files and type "make". To run the program type FindComponents in1 out1. FindComponent
parses the data in "in1" and finds all the strongly connected components alond with showing the user the Adjacency
List used to extract the data. The output is written to "out1".

Files Submitted: List.c, List.h, ListTest.c, Graph.c, Graph.h, GraphTest.c, FindComponents.c, Makefile, and README

List.c:             Contains the doubly linked List ADT and all its functions.

List.h:             Contains all the functions names in List.c to be used in FindComponent.c

ListTest.c:         Contains a program that uses the List ADT to make sure everything
                    is in order by calling all of its functions. 

Graph.c:            Contains the Graph ADT along with the DFS functions

Graph.h:            Contains all the function names in Graph.c to be used in FindComponent.c

GraphTest.c:        Contains a program that uses the Graph ADT to make sure everything 
                    is in order by calling all of its functions. 

FindComponents.c:   Contains the top level program that reads in a formated file and turns it into
                    a graph. It then proceeds to run DFS on the graph and finds its SCCs. 

Makefile:           Compiles everything and makes the Shuffle program into a jar file.

README:              The title serves its purpose.
